## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML provides the input fields and content.

CSS styles the page to look like a checklist in a notebook.

JavaScript allows the user to select multiple checkboxes by holding the shift key while selecting two checkboxes.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I would like to add features to allow the user to edit list items. Also, they will be able to add new items and delete items from the list as well as move itmes to different categories.

## Lessons Learned:

So many things we take for granted on the web, I always thought that being able to select multiple emails in GMail was a default feature. I thought that upon making multiple checkboxes on my webpage that would be an innate feature. With this project, I learned how to implement that functionality so that I can create more responsive webapps.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
